# Overview
For my practicum/capstone project, I worked with [OneBlood](https://www.oneblood.org/) to develop predictive models for blood donor propensity. Given a deidentified dataset of past donations, I trained, validated, and tested models to support:
1. Identification of high-propensity donors for direct outreach
2. Forecasting of aggregate donations for planning

The final report submitted to Georgia Tech and OneBlood (the partnering organization) is included in the `/reports` directory. All of my code is also included in `/notebooks`.

# Additional Notes
* The first column of `2015.csv` was named `random_ID` instead of `Random_ID`. I manually modified this.
