# Overview
For my practicum/capstone project, I worked with a non-profit blood donation organization to develop predictive models for blood donor propensity. Given a deidentified dataset of past donations, I trained, validated, and tested models to support:
1. Identification of high-propensity donors for direct outreach
2. Forecasting of aggregate donations for planning

The final report submitted to Georgia Tech and the partnering organization is included in the `/reports` directory. All of my code is also included in `/notebooks`.
